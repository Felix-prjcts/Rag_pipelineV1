# Mini RAG / NLP Project

This is an experimental prototype using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline on text documents.  
It includes:

- Chunking of documents
- Embeddings with `SentenceTransformer` (MiniLM-L6)
- Vector indexing and search with `Qdrant`
- Text generation using a HuggingFace model (`Flan-T5`)

> Note: This is a test project and a hybrid approach combining semantic search and BM25 is planned to improve results.

## Goal
- Explore a RAG pipeline for legal or economic documents.
- Understand embeddings, vector indexing, and text generation in practice.
- Provide a lightweight prototype for experimentation.

## Installation
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
